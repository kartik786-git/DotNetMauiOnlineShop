## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The application strictly follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to ensure separation of concerns and testability.

### 📂 Project Structure

- **Models** (`/Models`)
  - `Product`: Data model for store items.
  - `Order`: Represents a customer order with `Items` and `Status`.
  - `CartItem`: Represents items added to the cart w/ Quantity.
  - `Category`: Product categorization.

- **ViewModels** (`/ViewModels`)
  - Inherit from `BaseViewModel` (handles `IsBusy`, `Title`).
  - `HomeViewModel`: Fetches categories and products. Handles navigation.
  - `ProductDetailsViewModel`: Manages product selection and "Add to Cart" logic.
  - `CartViewModel`: Loads cart items and handles checkout logic.
  - `OrdersViewModel`: Fetches order history and logs on-screen debug info (if enabled).
  - Uses `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]` for boilerplate reduction.

- **Views** (`/Views`)
  - `HomePage`: Main landing with `CollectionView` grid.
  - `ProductDetailsPage`: Detailed view with hero image parallax concepts.
  - `CartPage`: Cart summary and checkout.
  - `OrdersPage`: List of orders with custom XAML triggers for status colors.

- **Services** (`/Services`)
  - `ApiService`: Centralized HTTP client.
    - Handles endpoints: `/api/products`, `/api/cart`, `/api/orders`.
    - **Smart Image Assessment**: Automatically assigns Unsplash images based on product keywords (e.g., "iPhone" -> Phone Image) to prevent empty placeholders.
